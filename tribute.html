            <p>
                Steve Jobs, (born Feb. 24, 1955, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.—died Oct. 5, 2011, Palo Alto, Calif.), U.S. businessman. 
                Adopted in infancy, he grew up in Cupertino, Calif. He dropped out of Reed College and went to work for Atari Corp. 
                designing video games.

                Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained 
                fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. 
                Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). 
                This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, 
                the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the 
                addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 
                after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few Apple 
                employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education 
                and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics 
                division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature 
                film Toy Story (1995), and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 20 films since then.

            In 1980 Apple became a public corporation, and Jobs became the company’s chairman. Management conflicts led him to leave 
                Apple in 1985 to form NeXT Computer Inc., but he returned to Apple in 1996 and became CEO in 1997. The striking new iMac 
                computer (1998) revived the company’s flagging fortunes. Under Jobs’s guidance, Apple became an industry leader and one of 
                the most valuable companies in the world. Its other notable products include iTunes (2001), the iPod (2001), the iPhone (2007),
                and the iPad (2010). In 2003 Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and he subsequently took several medical leaves of 
                absence. In 2011 he resigned as CEO of Apple but became chairman.Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003.
                He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.
